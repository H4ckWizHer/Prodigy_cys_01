CEASER'S CIPHER ENCRYPTION DECRYPTION TOOL
# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this implementation, users can encrypt and decrypt messages using a command-line interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have Python installed on your computer. This code is compatible with Python 3.6 and above. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

To get the project running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https:(https://github.com/H4ckWizHer/Prodigy_cys_01/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd caesar-cipher
3. Run the program.

## How to Use

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu:
Menu:

Encrypt a message
Decrypt a message
Exit
Enter your choice (1-3):

- To encrypt a message, enter `1`, followed by the message and the shift number.
- To decrypt a message, choose `2`, and similarly, provide the message to decrypt and the shift number used for encryption.
- Select `3` to exit the program.

### Example

Encrypting a message:

Enter your choice (1-3): 1
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift number: 3
The encrypted text is: Khoor, Zruog!

Decrypting a message:

Enter your choice (1-3): 2
Enter your message: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift number: 3
The decrypted text is: Hello, World!
